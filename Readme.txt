This will be a learning projcect wherein I use Java code to create a game called Conquest.

The Idea of the Conquest game is similar to the famous RTS style games such as StarCraft.

There will be "Rooms" to capture, build in, and Defend.

Sallius is working on the Wiki and Story boards.  Rosa will be working on the Code.  We will see how many other developers will join and what their tasks will be.
